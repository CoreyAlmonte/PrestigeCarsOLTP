Unfortunately our group did not manage to connect most of the tables of the normalized database and with the looming finals, almost everyone opted to study for those instead. What I have here is the uploaded zip file of our group's effort. While most of the work was not last minute (most of this was written before the tenth), my group did seem to struggle with consistently submitting work over time until time caught up. On the last day, aside from me and Sadia, most of the group was unable to take part in the final stretch, but they did code a lot.
